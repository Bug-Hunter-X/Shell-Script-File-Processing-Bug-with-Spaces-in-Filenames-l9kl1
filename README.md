This repository demonstrates a common error in shell scripting when handling filenames with spaces. The `bug.sh` script shows the erroneous code that incorrectly handles files with spaces in their names. The solution, `bugSolution.sh`, provides a corrected version that uses proper quoting to prevent word splitting and correctly processes filenames with spaces.  This is a common issue that can lead to unexpected behavior and errors. The solution highlights the importance of careful quoting in shell scripts to ensure correct handling of filenames and other arguments.
